## Review Weeks

- 5
- 10
- 15
- and any major holiday break

## Lesson Template

- [link to lesson template](Lesson%20Template.md)
- use the old todo list for all of the coding examples in the lessons
  - it exists already
  - it is not a complex project but still contains all of the elements of each lesson
  - it exposes the student to more code than just the work-along project

## Proposed Instructional Project Submission Workflow

- [link to workflow](Submission%20Workflow.md)

## Uncovered topics

- deploying vanilla React app
- 3rd party libraries
- unit testing
- integration testing
- e2e testing

## Other considerations

- [ ] Error boundaries must be done in class components
- [ ] do not forget README instructions
- [ ] consider useRefs instead of some useEffect (as appropriate)

## Stretch Goals

- [ ] research what else gets copied over in a forked repo or a repo as a template (what can be done for testing)
- [ ] bare-bones testing with jest
  - [ ] consider Cypress instead of TDD
